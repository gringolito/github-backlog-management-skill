# Backlog

The backlog skills read this file for the repo's Project and label vocabulary. Edit it to change either.

## Project

<owner>/<repo> Backlog: <project URL> (project number <number>)

## Labels

Every backlog item carries one type, one priority and one effort label, except ideas and external blockers, which carry only their type. Replace a default below with the repo's own label where one is mapped.

### Type

- `type:feature`: New capability or user-visible behaviour not yet present
- `type:bug`: Incorrect behaviour deviating from a documented or expected contract
- `type:security`: Vulnerability, auth gap, data-exposure risk, or compliance hardening
- `type:performance`: Latency, throughput, memory, or resource-efficiency improvement
- `type:dx`: Contributor-facing improvement: CI, tooling, contributing docs
- `type:tech-debt`: Internal restructuring; no user-visible behaviour change
- `type:reliability`: Uptime, error recovery, observability, or graceful-degradation improvement
- `type:compliance`: Regulatory, legal, or contractual obligation
- `type:spike`: Time-boxed investigation to reduce uncertainty; deliverable is knowledge
- `type:epic`: Large body of work, split into sub-issues
- `type:external-blocker`: External constraint blocking a backlog item (Stub)
- `type:idea`: Rough idea parked for later; not yet defined, prioritized or sized

### Priority

- `priority:P0`: Critical: system broken, data loss, or no viable workaround
- `priority:P1`: High: major user or business impact
- `priority:P2`: Medium: planned work; not blocking anything critical
- `priority:P3`: Low: nice-to-have; easily deferred without consequence

### Effort

- `effort:XS`: Trivial: config tweak, one-liner, or doc edit
- `effort:S`: Small: focused change in one file or component
- `effort:M`: Medium: multiple files or components; some design thought
- `effort:L`: Large: cross-cutting; multiple subsystems or substantial design
- `effort:XL`: Extra large: major undertaking; probably needs a split plan

### Other

- `needs-clarification`: Item needs more information before it can be worked
